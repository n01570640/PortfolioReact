**About GurpreetKaurResume project**

This project is a web-based resume application developed using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The application serves as a dynamic portfolio, showcasing the user's skills, education, and work history. Data is fetched from the Express.js server via RESTful API calls and presented in a visually engaging Carousel interface designed with React-Bootstrap.

**Key Features:**
 - **Dynamic Data Fetching**: The application uses RESTful API calls to fetch real-time data from the server, allowing for easy updates to the resume details.
 - **Reusable Components**: The frontend incorporates reusable components such as DataList, which takes care of rendering lists of data, thereby making the application easily extendable.
 - **Custom Hooks**: A custom React hook, UseFetchData, is utilized for fetching data from the server, providing a cleaner and more modular approach to data management.
 - **Stylish UI**: React-Bootstrap's Carousel component is used to add a touch of dynamism to the resume, making it more engaging to navigate through the user's skills, education, and work history.
 - **Responsive Design**: The application is built using Bootstrap, making it fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
 - **Error Handling**: The application handles errors gracefully by capturing them during the data-fetching process, thereby enhancing the user experience.
 - **CORS Support**: CORS is configured properly to enable secure communication between the frontend and the backend
